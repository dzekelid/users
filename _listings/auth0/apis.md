name: Auth0
description: Authenticate and authorize apps and APIs with any popular identity provider
  (enterprise, social or custom) running on any popular software stack on any popular
  device or cloud with Auth0s identity-as-a-service. Run from the Auth0 public cloud
  service, from a private cloud instance, or on-prem. Auth0 allows developers to replace
  painfully brittle in-app auth code with a call to an easy-to-use cloud service.
  Auth0 is particularly useful in eliminating the pain of dealing with a complex identity
  environment. Auth0 further allows IT to quickly set up SSO for any SAML-compliant
  3rd party app (SaaS or on-prem).
